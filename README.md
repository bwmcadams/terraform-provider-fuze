# Fuze Terraform Provider

**NOTE**: *This fork updates the outdated code of the root branch to work with latest version of the ignition codeâ€¦ I still need to send a PR*

The Fuze provider exposes data sources to render [Ignition] [1]
configurations in the human-friendly [Fuze] [2] YAML format into
JSON.  The rendered JSON strings can be used as input to other
Terraform resources, e.g. as user-data for cloud instances.
